-- Unify Branch Assignment into Transfer Requests + branch_name on
-- employee_info_view.
--
-- 1. transfer_requests.from_branch_id becomes nullable: the older "Branch
--    Assignment" action (instant, no approval) is being replaced by Transfer
--    Requests for every branch move, including assigning a *currently
--    unassigned* employee, which has no prior branch to record.
-- 2. employee_info_view gains branch_name (LEFT JOIN branches) so the UI can
--    stop showing a raw branch_id UUID.
--
-- No new indexes: transfer_requests already has employee_id/from_branch_id/
-- to_branch_id/status indexes (20260910010000_transfer_requests_and_employee_contact.sql)
-- and profiles already has a branch_id index (20260903010000_rbac_branch_scoping.sql).
--
-- Idempotent — safe to run more than once.

-- branch_name via LEFT JOIN so an unassigned employee (branch_id IS NULL)
-- still appears in the view rather than being silently dropped by an INNER
-- JOIN. security_invoker keeps profiles' own RLS (profiles_select_branch) as
-- the actual access decision, same as the original view.
--
-- branch_name is appended LAST, not inserted after branch_id: CREATE OR
-- REPLACE VIEW only allows adding a trailing column — every existing column
-- must stay in its original position, or Postgres reports it as trying to
-- rename that position (error 42P16).
