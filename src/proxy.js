/**
 * RBAC proxy (Next.js 16's replacement for middleware.js) — the first thing
 * every request passes through.
 *
 * Two jobs:
 *
 *   1. API routes — map each /api/** path to a module, map the HTTP verb to an
 *      action, and reject the request with 401/403 before the handler runs if
 *      the caller's role has no such permission in the matrix.
 *
 *   2. Portal pages — keep a signed-in user out of another role's portal
 *      (/admin, /super-admin, ...). Until now this was enforced only in
 *      public/legacy/js/app.js from a localStorage value the user can edit.
 *
 * This is the coarse, uniform layer: "may this role touch this module at all".
 * Branch scoping and the User Management role ceiling need to look at the
 * request body or the rows involved, so they are enforced inside the handlers
 * via src/lib/rbac/guard.js. Both layers read the same matrix.
 *
 * Session verification uses node:crypto, which needs the Node.js runtime —
 * that's the default for this file (Next.js's middleware/proxy layer runs on
 * Node.js unless told otherwise), so nothing has to opt into it. Setting
 * `runtime` explicitly in this config is invalid in Next.js 16 and throws on
 * every request, which is worse than not setting it at all: don't add it back.
