/**
 * SACS Payroll — single source of truth for role-based access control.
 *
 * Mirrors "Section 2 — Full Ordered Permission Matrix" in
 * SACS-Payroll-Permission-Matrix.md. Nothing in this system should hardcode a
 * role name to decide access; ask this table instead, via can() / scopeFor().
 *
 * Two independent dimensions, exactly as the matrix describes them:
 *
 *   SCOPE  — how much data a role may reach:
 *            'all'    every branch (super_admin everywhere; HR on every
 *                     module it can reach -- HR accounts carry no branch)
 *            'branch' rows whose branch_id equals the caller's own branch
 *            'self'   rows belonging to the caller personally
 *            'none'   no access to the module at all
 *
 *   ACTIONS — what the role may do inside that scope: create / read /
 *             update / delete.
 *
 * NOTE ON 'delete': across this system "delete" means ARCHIVE (set the record
 * inactive), never a physical row removal. Payroll and attendance history must
 * stay referentially intact, so no role — super_admin included — is granted a
 * hard delete. See assertNoHardDelete() below.
