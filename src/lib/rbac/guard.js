/**
 * Route guard — the single place every API route asks "may this caller do
 * this?".
 *
 * Each guarded handler starts with one call:
 *
 *   const guard = await requirePermission(request, "user_management", "create");
 *   if (guard.denied) return guard.denied;      // 401 / 403 NextResponse
 *
 * and then uses `guard.branchId` to scope its queries. The guard answers both
 * halves of the rule at once:
 *
 *   (a) does the caller's role permit this action on this module?
 *   (b) if the role is branch-scoped, which branch_id is it pinned to?
 *
 * The API routes hold the Supabase service-role key, which bypasses Row Level
 * Security entirely — so RLS alone can never protect them. This guard is the
 * layer that actually enforces the matrix on those routes; the RLS policies in
 * supabase/migrations/20260903010000_rbac_branch_scoping.sql are the second layer,
 * covering any client that talks to Postgres directly with a user JWT.
